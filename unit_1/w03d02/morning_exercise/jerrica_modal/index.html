        <h1>Learn to Play Bridge</h1>
        <!-- about -->
        <p>Bridge is played with four people sitting at a card table using a standard deck of 52 cards (no jokers). The players across from each other form partnerships as North‑South and East‑West.</p>
        <p>Draw cards to select the person to deal the cards (the dealer). This person distributes the cards face down, in clockwise rotation one at a time, until each player at the table has a hand consisting of 13 cards. </p>
        <p>After the play of each deal is completed, the opportunity to deal moves around the table clockwise so that each person has a turn to deal out the cards.</p>
