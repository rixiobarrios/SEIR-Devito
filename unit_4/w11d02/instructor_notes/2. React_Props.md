## Props 

We went over props briefly yesterday, but let's talk a little more about them now. Props and state are usually the hardest concepts to wrap your head around when getting into React, so a nice refresher is always helpful.

First, let's think think back to our React Store, where we had just one component. It was a pretty small app, so one component was fine in that case. But if were to continue building out functionality, our one component would get very complex and the code could expand to hundreds or thousands of lines. Maintaining such a large, single component would be really hard.

This is the beauty of React, you're able to separate things out into smaller, more manageable and even reusable components. However, once we separate things out into different components, some things might then lose access to data or state that  exists in a different copmonent. This is where props come in. In React, data flows down via props. 

Let's see it in action by continuing our Tunr build 

## Continuing our Tunr App

Before we continue, let's remind ourselves what we built thus far and what next we want to do

#### What we have so far: 

- The ability to see our playlist data
- The ability to add a song onto our playlist 
- An App component that has all of the above, and a Playlist component that just renders a header 

#### Where we're going next: 

- We're going to reorganize our code into their relevant components
  - We'll move our playlist into the Playlist component 
  - We'll create a new Component called Song and move our mapped out songs into there 
- We'll add the ability to 'like' a song 

So, let's get started! 

## Moving the playlist into our new component 

#### From App.js -> Playlist.js

Move the `div` with a class of playlist out of App.js and into Playlist.js

```js
<div className="playlist">
  <h1>{this.state.playlist.title}</h1>
  <div className="songs">
  {this.state.playlist.songs.map ((song, index) => {
    return(
      <div className="song" key={index}>
        <h1>{song.title}</h1>
        <h2>{song.artist}</h2>
        <h3>{song.time}</h3>
      </div>
     )
   })}
  </div>
</div>
```

#### The Playlist.js component should now look like:

```js
class Playlist extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="playlist">
        <h1>{this.state.playlist.title}</h1>
        <div className="songs">
        {this.state.playlist.songs.map ((song, index) => {
          return(
            <div className="song" key={index}>
              <h1>{song.title}</h1>
              <h2>{song.artist}</h2>
              <h3>{song.time}</h3>
            </div>
           )
         })}
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

If you look at your browser, this of course gives us an error!

This is because our Playlist component _does not_ have state. Sure, we could simply define state inside of the Playlist component and import the data here as well, but that wouldn't be very efficient at all. Remember, our form to add a new song is still on the App component, and that requires using the data saved in the App component's state. So, if we updated the state in the App component, would it similarly be updated in the state of the Playlist component? No, and this is where props come into play. 

Remember again, data flows down in React through props. We can simply just add a property onto the `<Playlist/>` element that we rendered in `App` to pass the data down into the `Playlist` component. So, let's do that! 

##### In App.js where we have the <Playlist/> element

Add a property of playlist and pass in `this.state.playlist` so that the Playlist componenet now has access to the playlist data. 

```jsx
<Playlist playlist={this.state.playlist}/>
```

##### In Playlist.js 

Now, we just have to replace all the `this.state` to `this.props` so that your Playlist component now looks like:

```jsx
class Playlist extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="playlist">
        <h1>{this.props.playlist.title}</h1>
        <div className="songs">
        {this.props.playlist.songs.map ((song, index) => {
          return(
            <div className="song" key={index}>
              <h1>{song.title}</h1>
              <h2>{song.artist}</h2>
              <h3>{song.time}</h3>
            </div>
           )
         })}
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
And now it works again, sweet! 

## Creating a Component That Has Both Props and State 

Next, we'll show you that a component can have _both_ props and state. State does **not** only have to exist in parent components, children components can certainly have them as well. Just remember that, again, data flows _down_ in React. So, just watch where you're putting your state if other components need to access data from it as well. 

### Create the Song component 

#### In terminal, make sure you're in the root of the tunr_app directory and run 

  - `touch src/components/Song.js` 

#### In Song.js 

Create the bare bones of a component like we did for Playlist and App in the morning lecture 

```js
// ===================
// DEPENDENCIES
// ===================
// packages
import React, { Component } from 'react'; 

// ===================
// COMPONENT
// ===================
class Song extends Component {
  render() {
    return
  }
}

// ===================
// EXPORT
// ===================
export default Song;
```

#### In Playlist.js

First, let's import our Song component 

```js
import Song from './Song';
```

Cut the `div` with a class of song out of Playlist.js and replace it with <Song />

```jsx
<div className="songs">
{this.state.playlist.songs.map ((song, index) => {
  return(
    <Song/>
   )
 })}
</div>
```

#### Back in Song.js 

Paste the `div` with a class of song into the render's return 

```jsx
class Song extends Component {
  render() {
    return(
      <div className="song" key={index}>
        <h1>{song.title}</h1>
        <h2>{song.artist}</h2>
        <h3>{song.time}</h3>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

An error again! 

![](https://i.imgur.com/1xtmeaC.png)

Because again we took it out of context, so none of these variables exist inside of the Song component. We know how to fix that already, we're going to pass the data down as props. So, thinking ahead, we then know we're going to want to refer to these variables as props in the Song component. Let's just go ahead and fix that now by adding `this.props` in front of all the undefined variables 

```jsx
class Song extends Component {
  render() {
    return(
      <div className="song" key={this.props.index}>
        <h1>{this.props.song.title}</h1>
        <h2>{this.props.song.artist}</h2>
        <h3>{this.props.song.time}</h3>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

#### In Playlist.js 

Don't worry about the error, we already know why. So, let's pass down the data as props into our `<Song/>` element 

```jsx
<Song
  index={index}
  song={song}
/>
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/wGKTpSk.png)

If you look in the console, you see the unique "key" prop error again. Even though we have the `key` prop in our Song component, React doesn't know that as it only looks for it directly inside of the map function. So, let's fix that by just changing the name of the index prop: 

```jsx
<Song 
  key={index}
  song={song}
/>
```

And in `Song.js` you can just get rid of the key property on the outer div: 

```jsx
<div className="song">
  <h1>{this.props.song.title}</h1>
  <h2>{this.props.song.artist}</h2>
  <h3>{this.props.song.time}</h3>
</div>
```

Alright! That's great and all, but our Song component still only has props. Let's add state now by adding the ability to 'like' a song.

### Adding the like functionality in Song.js

To add the like functionality, let's first add a state into the Song component called 'liked' that'll have a boolean as a value. On default, we'll set it to false. And then to add the like functionality, we'll toggle it between false/true by adding a click event on the song.

Remember, if we want a component to have state, we must add the constructor function 

```js
constructor () {
  super()
  this.state = {
    liked: false
  }
}
```

Next, let's conditionally render a heart next to the song depending on whether or not it's liked. We'll do so by adding a ternary operator that will only display a heart if `this.state.liked` is true.

```jsx
<div className="song">
  <h1>{this.props.song.title}</h1>
  <h2>{this.props.song.artist}</h2>
  <h3>{this.props.song.time}</h3>
  { this.state.liked ? <h4>&hearts;</h4> : null }
</div>
```

Sweet, now we need to actually add the click event, so let's first create the event handler that'll toggle the state of liked

```js
toggleLike() {
  this.setState({ liked: !this.state.liked })
}
```

<details><summary><strong>Don't forget to `.bind(this)` to the constructor since we're referencing `this` inside the method</strong></summary><p>
  
   ```js
    this.toggleLike = this.toggleLike.bind(this);
   ```
    
</p></details>

Finally, let's add the event listener `onClick` onto the parent div of the song so that if the user clicks the song anywhere it will trigger the toggleLike handler

```jsx
<div className="song" onClick={this.toggleLike}>
```

Now we should be able to click on any song and see the heart appear and disappear based on the song's state. 

And that's it! We now have a component that utilizes both props and state.

## Hungry for More? 

Try doing some of these!

- Double click the song name to delete it from the list
- Add functionality that lets you click on an icon (maybe an arrow?) of two songs and then swaps their order
- Allow for multiple playlists to be rendered, when adding a new song, let a user select a playlist to add to or to create a new playlist
- Remove my CSS and try styling it on your own!
